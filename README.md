# PHP-Login-System

This is a PHP Login-System Demonstration, Wrote this watching a youtube tutorial after doing the the Pre-work for my bootcamp. I'm not sure how people are going to be able practically use this login system since the Database that is referred to is hosted on my local machine and i currently do not know how to upload the Database to Github, none the less anyone can fork the code and apply this to their own database. Don't mind the styling it's purely just for the code (maybe i'll get around to mobile Responsiveness).
